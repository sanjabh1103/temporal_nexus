TEMPORAL NEXUS Product Requirements Document (PRD)https://bolt.new/~/sb1-aeeavddp
Introduction
Purpose: The TEMPORAL NEXUS is a revolutionary decision-making platform designed to optimize choices across time dimensions, helping users decide not just what to do but when to do it. By integrating temporal optimization, counterfactual life simulation, collective intelligence, and quantum decision modeling, it empowers individuals to make informed decisions about career changes, investments, relocations, and more, with a focus on minimizing regret and maximizing outcomes.
Scope: The platform combines the Temporal Decision Arbitrage, Counterfactual Life Simulator, Swarm Wisdom Predictor, and Quantum Decision Engine. It uses Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM for intelligent data processing, SupaBase for secure storage and authentication (with guest login support), and Netlify for scalable deployment. Local browser storage (localStorage) caches user profiles, decision details, and simulation results to optimize performance. Key features include timing analysis, path simulation, collective insights, probability cloud visualization, and regret minimization strategies.
